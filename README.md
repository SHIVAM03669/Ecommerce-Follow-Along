# Ecommerce-Follow-Along  
**Milestone 1**

## Project Overview

We will use the MERN Stack, a JavaScript-based technology stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for building full-stack web applications, simplifying development for beginners.

We will implement an API structure that enables client-server communication using HTTP methods. For example:

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in users.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
- **Order Handling**: Manage customer orders, with all data exchanged in JSON format.
- **Database Schema Design**: Defines data structure and relationships in MongoDB to organize and optimize data storage.

### Authentication Role:
Verifies user identity to secure sensitive actions like purchases and viewing orders.

At the end of this milestone, we will create an eCommerce website.

**Milestone 2 Overview**

In this milestone, I have successfully implemented the following key features for the eCommerce project:

- **Project Folder Structure**: I have organized the project files by separating the frontend and backend directories, ensuring a clean and manageable structure for the application.
  
- **React Frontend Setup**: I initialized a React application to build the user interface, laying the groundwork for further UI development.

- **Node.js Backend Setup**: I set up a simple Node.js server to handle the backend processes, preparing it for future API integration.

- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: I integrated and configured Tailwind CSS, which enables modern, responsive, and utility-based styling for the website, enhancing the overall look and feel of the UI.

- **Login Page Development**: I developed the first user interface of the e-commerce application, focusing on both functionality (user authentication) and styling (using Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design).

With these features in place, the foundation for a fully functioning e-commerce site is well established. I can now proceed to integrate more complex features in the upcoming milestones.

# Milestone 3 Overview

In this milestone, I have successfully implemented the following key features for the backend project:

### Backend Folder Structure
I have meticulously organized the backend project files by creating a well-defined hierarchy. This includes separating essential components such as routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure not only ensures a clean and manageable codebase but also lays the foundation for scaling the application as new features are added. Additionally, I have started understanding terms like *utils* and *middlewares*, which play an integral role in backend development.

### Node.js Server Setup
To handle API requests efficiently, I set up a Node.js server using Express. The server has been configured to listen on a designated port, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. This setup serves as the backbone for managing backend processes and acts as a gateway for future API integrations. 

### MongoDB Integration
I successfully integrated MongoDB into the project, enabling efficient and reliable data storage. The integration process included setting up a connection between the server and the database, which has been thoroughly tested and confirmed. This step ensures that the application can handle data management seamlessly, paving the way for robust CRUD operations.

### Error Handling Implementation
Recognizing the importance of a resilient application, I implemented basic error-handling mechanisms. These include providing clear error messages that enhance the debugging process and offer better user feedback. The error handling setup not only improves the reliability of the application but also makes it more developer-friendly for future troubleshooting and enhancements.

### Additional Notes
Throughout this milestone, I have followed best practices to ensure that the backend code remains modular and maintainable. By adhering to a structured approach, I have set a solid groundwork that will support the development of more advanced features in subsequent milestones. This milestone also served as an opportunity to enhance my understanding of backend architecture and the integration of modern tools like MongoDB.

With these achievements, the foundation for a robust and scalable backend system is firmly in place. Moving forward, I am well-prepared to tackle more complex functionalities, optimize the existing codebase, and ensure the backend system aligns seamlessly with the project’s overall goals.
