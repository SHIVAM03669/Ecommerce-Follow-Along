# Ecommerce-Follow-Along  
**Milestone 1**

## Project Overview

We will use the MERN Stack, a JavaScript-based technology stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for building full-stack web applications, simplifying development for beginners.

We will implement an API structure that enables client-server communication using HTTP methods. For example:

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in users.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
- **Order Handling**: Manage customer orders, with all data exchanged in JSON format.
- **Database Schema Design**: Defines data structure and relationships in MongoDB to organize and optimize data storage.

### Authentication Role:
Verifies user identity to secure sensitive actions like purchases and viewing orders.

At the end of this milestone, we will create an eCommerce website.

**Milestone 2 Overview**

In this milestone, I have successfully implemented the following key features for the eCommerce project:

- **Project Folder Structure**: I have organized the project files by separating the frontend and backend directories, ensuring a clean and manageable structure for the application.
  
- **React Frontend Setup**: I initialized a React application to build the user interface, laying the groundwork for further UI development.

- **Node.js Backend Setup**: I set up a simple Node.js server to handle the backend processes, preparing it for future API integration.

- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: I integrated and configured Tailwind CSS, which enables modern, responsive, and utility-based styling for the website, enhancing the overall look and feel of the UI.

- **Login Page Development**: I developed the first user interface of the e-commerce application, focusing on both functionality (user authentication) and styling (using Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design).

With these features in place, the foundation for a fully functioning e-commerce site is well established. I can now proceed to integrate more complex features in the upcoming milestones.
