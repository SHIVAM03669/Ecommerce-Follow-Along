## Project Overview

**Milestone 1**

We will use the MERN Stack, a JavaScript-based technology stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for building full-stack web applications, simplifying development for beginners.

We will implement an API structure that enables client-server communication using HTTP methods. For example:

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in users.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
- **Order Handling**: Manage customer orders, with all data exchanged in JSON format.
- **Database Schema Design**: Defines data structure and relationships in MongoDB to organize and optimize data storage.

### Authentication Role:
Verifies user identity to secure sensitive actions like purchases and viewing orders.

At the end of this milestone, we will create an eCommerce website.

 Milestone 3 Overview

In this milestone, I have successfully implemented the following key features for the backend project:

### Backend Folder Structure
I have meticulously organized the backend project files by creating a well-defined hierarchy. This includes separating essential components such as routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure not only ensures a clean and manageable codebase but also lays the foundation for scaling the application as new features are added. Additionally, I have started understanding terms like *utils* and *middlewares*, which play an integral role in backend development.

### Node.js Server Setup
To handle API requests efficiently, I set up a Node.js server using Express. The server has been configured to listen on a designated port, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. This setup serves as the backbone for managing backend processes and acts as a gateway for future API integrations. 

### MongoDB Integration
I successfully integrated MongoDB into the project, enabling efficient and reliable data storage. The integration process included setting up a connection between the server and the database, which has been thoroughly tested and confirmed. This step ensures that the application can handle data management seamlessly, paving the way for robust CRUD operations.

### Error Handling Implementation
Recognizing the importance of a resilient application, I implemented basic error-handling mechanisms. These include providing clear error messages that enhance the debugging process and offer better user feedback. The error handling setup not only improves the reliability of the application but also makes it more developer-friendly for future troubleshooting and enhancements.

### Additional Notes
Throughout this milestone, I have followed best practices to ensure that the backend code remains modular and maintainable. By adhering to a structured approach, I have set a solid groundwork that will support the development of more advanced features in subsequent milestones. This milestone also served as an opportunity to enhance my understanding of backend architecture and the integration of modern tools like MongoDB.

- **User Model Creation**: Designed a User Model as a blueprint for storing user data in the database. This includes defining fields such as:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Password
  
  The model ensures a structured approach to managing user information within the database.

- **User Controller Development**: Set up a User Controller to manage user-related operations, including:
  - Adding new users to the database.
  - Retrieving user information as required.
  - Managing other user-specific interactions.

- **File Upload Configuration with Multer**: Configured Multer to enable file uploads within the application. This includes:
  - Allowing users to upload files, such as profile pictures.
  - Storing these files efficiently in the backend.
  - Ensuring secure and organized file management.

- **README Update**: Updated the README file to document the key milestones and progress. This includes details about the User Model, Controller setup, and file upload functionality.

### Key Concepts Covered:

1. **Model**: Defined as a blueprint for the data structure, the User Model leverages MongoDB schemas to map out user information like a detailed plan.

2. **Controller**: Acts as the "manager" for handling user data operations, ensuring smooth interaction between the user and the backend system.

3. **File Uploads with Multer**: Implemented Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload and manage files, such as images, securely and efficiently.

With these features in place, the backend is now well-equipped to manage user data and support file uploads. This milestone establishes a strong foundation for further backend development and integration.

**Milestone 5 Overview**

In this milestone, I have successfully implemented the following key features for the user sign-up process in the application:

- **Frontend Sign-Up Page Design**: I created a clean and user-friendly Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS, ensuring an intuitive experience for users registering for the application.

- **Form Fields and User Inputs**: The form includes fields for essential user details:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Password
  
  These fields are designed to capture the necessary information required for account creation.

- **Form Validation**: I implemented form validation to ensure the following:
  - The email field accepts only correctly formatted email addresses.
  - The password meets specific security criteria, such as a minimum length.
  
  This step helps maintain data integrity and ensures that only valid information is sent to the backend.

- **Routing for Sign-Up**: I set up the necessary routes to handle user sign-up requests. This includes:
  - Configuring the frontend to send user input data to the server.
  - Preparing the backend to process and validate incoming data.

- **README Update**: I updated the README file to document the work accomplished in this milestone. This includes details about the Sign-Up Page design, form validation implementation, and routing setup.

With these features in place, the Sign-Up process is now functional and ready for further enhancements or integration with the backend system. This milestone lays a strong foundation for building a robust user authentication system in the upcoming milestones.
