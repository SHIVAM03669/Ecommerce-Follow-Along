# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

 Milestone 1
 
 Project Overview

- We will use MERN Stack. It is a JavaScript-based technology stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for building full-stack web applications, simplifying development for beginners.

- And we will use API Structure to Enables client-server communication using HTTP methods. For example :
  - User Authentication: Register and log in users.
  - Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
  - Order Handling: Manage customer orders, with all data exchanged in JSON format.

- Database Schema Design: Defines data structure and relationships in MongoDB to organize and optimize data storage.

- Authentication Role:Verifies user identity to secure sensitive actions like purchases and viewing orders.

- After using all this we will create a Ecommerce website.
